I have to create the namespace first before applying my folder for it to work on my side
kubectl apply -f express_4016_namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes

The busywait endpoint does scale down but it takes longer than 3 minutes
I use the envValue from assignment 2 (the deployment file) for easy testing to see which number to pass in my function will jack up the CPU usage.
User may change the envValue to increase/decrease CPU load
